" UNITEN is well-regarded, particularly for its strong engineering, computer science, and business programs. It has a solid reputation in Malaysia, especially in energy-related fields. The negative part is the facilities such as the swimming pool are close since my first year till 3 year now and there are limited parking so it's make hard to find."," uniten is well-regarded, particularly for its strong engineering, computer science, and business programs. it has a solid reputation in malaysia, especially in energy-related fields. the negative part is the facilities such as the swimming pool are close since my first year till 3 year now and there are limited parking so it's make hard to find."," uniten is well-regarded, particularly for its strong engineering, computer science, and business programs. it has a solid reputation in malaysia, especially in energy-related fields. the negative part is the facilities such as the swimming pool are close since my first year till 3 year now and there are limited parking so it's make hard to find."

"In my opinion, UNITEN is not really a student-oriented university even though it is a private university. The facility is not in well-maintained condition and the flexibility of using the facilities is low. The number of students also low compared to other universities.","in my opinion, uniten is not really a student-oriented university even though it is a private university. the facility is not in well-maintained condition and the flexibility of using the facilities is low. the number of students also low compared to other universities.","in my opinion, uniten is not really a student-oriented university even though it is a private university. the facility is not in well-maintained condition and the flexibility of using the facilities is low. the number of students also low compared to other universities."
"UNITEN today is the shadow of its former self. What attracted me to UNITEN in the first place is not there anymore, e.g; our very own faculty building. The student dedicated website is terrible. I can name thousands of thousands website that is infinitely better. The hostel room application is ridiculous. The only pros that I could ever think of is the location of the campus that is situated near to major cities.","uniten today is the shadow of its former self. what attracted me to uniten in the first place is not there anymore, e.g; our very own faculty building. the student dedicated website is terrible. i can name thousands of thousands website that is infinitely better. the hostel room application is ridiculous. the only pros that i could ever think of is the location of the campus that is situated near to major cities.","uniten today is the shadow of its former self. what attracted me to uniten in the first place is not there anymore, e.g; our very own faculty building. the student dedicated website is terrible. i can name thousands of thousands website that is infinitely better. the hostel room application is ridiculous. the only pros that i could ever think of is the location of the campus that is situated near to major cities."

"UNITEN is a solid choice for students interested in engineering, IT, or energy-related fields, offering strong industry connections and modern facilities. However, its specialized focus and location may not suit everyone. If youâ€™re looking for a university with a strong technical emphasis and ties to the energy sector, UNITEN could be a great fit. If you prefer a more diverse academic environment or a bustling social scene, you might want to explore other options.","uniten is a solid choice for students interested in engineering, it, or energy-related fields, offering strong industry connections and modern facilities. however, its specialized focus and location may not suit everyone. if youâ€™re looking for a university with a strong technical emphasis and ties to the energy sector, uniten could be a great fit. if you prefer a more diverse academic environment or a bustling social scene, you might want to explore other options.","uniten is a solid choice for students interested in engineering, it, or energy-related fields, offering strong industry connections and modern facilities. however, its specialized focus and location may not suit everyone. if youâ€re looking for a university with a strong technical emphasis and ties to the energy sector, uniten could be a great fit. if you prefer a more diverse academic environment or a bustling social scene, you might want to explore other options."

"Uniten is unnecessarily expensive for the service it's offering. It is practically 10 times the price of a normal public university with barely any additional service. Most service center is broken, some road light doesn't even lit up and certain buildings are either close or straight up close off making the layout of the campus make less and less sense throughout the year. The service quality also isn't much better than the local ones therefore making the price tags makes less sense. The management side also isn't a huge downside. Schedule are a mess, events handled in exchange of student comfort and the report system keep making us report the same thing over and over again instead of putting on a timer or weight to solve the solution. Overall, 10/10, will never do this again.","uniten is unnecessarily expensive for the service it's offering. it is practically 10 times the price of a normal public university with barely any additional service. most service center is broken, some road light doesn't even lit up and certain buildings are either close or straight up close off making the layout of the campus make less and less sense throughout the year. the service quality also isn't much better than the local ones therefore making the price tags makes less sense. the management side also isn't a huge downside. schedule are a mess, events handled in exchange of student comfort and the report system keep making us report the same thing over and over again instead of putting on a timer or weight to solve the solution. overall, 10/10, will never do this again.","uniten is unnecessarily expensive for the service it's offering. it is practically 10 times the price of a normal public university with barely any additional service. most service center is broken, some road light doesn't even lit up and certain buildings are either close or straight up close off making the layout of the campus make less and less sense throughout the year. the service quality also isn't much better than the local ones therefore making the price tags makes less sense. the management side also isn't a huge downside. schedule are a mess, events handled in exchange of student comfort and the report system keep making us report the same thing over and over again instead of putting on a timer or weight to solve the solution. overall, 10/10, will never do this again."
"FIrst of all, UNITEN Strong point is the lecturer there are so many great lecturers here that have such precious knowledge they are willing to share. The course selection is abundance and align with modern world. Then, their proximity to bunch of food is very convenient. That what I could deem positive part about it. For neutral part of it, is their facilities, there are some good like the classes especially the new renovated class at BM, then we found poor class such as BV Theatre, then we have Library which is such a good benchmark for other theatre. The road is serviceable. Then for bad part is their management, slow, frustrating and could be very annoying. The event are subpar at best, the SRC is barely noticeable. In general, bunch of Uniten features, they are towards the right direction but lacking at execution.

"As a UNITEN student, Iâ€™ve had a great experience so far. Lecturers are knowledgeable and approachable, always willing to help when needed. The campus facilities are well-maintained, including the labs, libraries, and study areas, which make learning more convenient. The academic workload is challenging but manageable, and the curriculum is industry-relevant, preparing us well for future careers. There are also many clubs and activities to join, making campus life more enjoyable.

"UNITEN has great academic potential, but there are several areas that need improvement, particularly in its facilities and management. Many classrooms and lecture halls have outdated equipment, including malfunctioning air conditioning and inadequate seating, making it uncomfortable for students. The library, while resourceful, requires better maintenance, more study spaces, and a stronger Wi-Fi connection. Additionally, sports and recreational facilities need urgent upgrades, as the gym lacks proper equipment and some sports courts are not well-maintained, discouraging student participation in extracurricular activities.

The universityâ€™s management and administrative processes also require improvement. Response times from offices such as finance and student affairs are often slow, leading to delays in resolving student concerns regarding fees and scholarships. Course registration is another major issue, with frequent system crashes and unclear guidelines creating unnecessary stress. Moreover, communication between the university and students needs enhancement, as important updates about policy changes, events, and academic matters are not always effectively conveyed. Addressing these issues will significantly enhance the student experience and ensure UNITEN remains a top choice for higher education.

"As a final year student, I have a mixed review or opinion about UNITEN. I loved the education. The syllabus taught to students are very comprehensive and up to date to the industry standard. This prepares students in the working industry when they graduate.

As for the facilities, its quite poor in quality. Example includes, roof leakage, broken toilet and damaged roads. There is also poor security controls. Anybody can enter in and out of UNITEN whether they are a student or complete stranger. This poses a threat to all of UNITEN community from students to staffs. 

Would i recommend this university to someone i know? No i would not. There are other universities out there that are miles better than UNITEN.

I feel neither good nor bad towards UNITEN. There are some aspects that I like such as the courses & syllabuses taught to us students. They are relevant for our future because Iâ€™ve used those knowledge during my internship and they were shocked that I know such things. The environment itself is also not bad. Library is comfortable. Classes have full lightings to study in. What I dont like is the lack of concerns towards studentsâ€™ practicality. Less parking spots. Difficulty to access uniten brighten or any uniten website during the release of examination results. Poor wifi connectivity.,i feel neither good nor bad towards uniten. there are some aspects that i like such as the courses & syllabuses taught to us students. they are relevant for our future because iâ€™ve used those knowledge during my internship and they were shocked that i know such things. the environment itself is also not bad. library is comfortable. classes have full lightings to study in. what i dont like is the lack of concerns towards studentsâ€™ practicality. less parking spots. difficulty to access uniten brighten or any uniten website during the release of examination results. poor wifi connectivity.,i feel neither good nor bad towards uniten. there are some aspects that i like such as the courses & syllabuses taught to us students. they are relevant for our future because iâ€ve used those knowledge during my internship and they were shocked that i know such things. the environment itself is also not bad. library is comfortable. classes have full lightings to study in. what i dont like is the lack of concerns towards studentsâ€ practicality. less parking spots. difficulty to access uniten brighten or any uniten website during the release of examination results. poor wifi connectivity.

"Saya merasakan uniten perlu improve dari segi system delay mereka dalam aspek student info ia akan mengganggu student untuk akses dalam web itu,Dari aspek kos pendidikan,ia terlalu mahal dan tidak mengikut harga yang di bayar mahal tersebut.Jika servis perkhidmatan pendidikan ia mahal perlulah mengikut prosedur tersebut.Maaf hanya sekadar hujahan sahaja.","saya merasakan uniten perlu improve dari segi system delay mereka dalam aspek student info ia akan mengganggu student untuk akses dalam web itu,dari aspek kos pendidikan,ia terlalu mahal dan tidak mengikut harga yang di bayar mahal tersebut.jika servis perkhidmatan pendidikan ia mahal perlulah mengikut prosedur tersebut.maaf hanya sekadar hujahan sahaja.","saya merasakan uniten perlu improve dari segi system delay mereka dalam aspek student info ia akan mengganggu student untuk akses dalam web itu,dari aspek kos pendidikan,ia terlalu mahal dan tidak mengikut harga yang di bayar mahal tersebut.jika servis perkhidmatan pendidikan ia mahal perlulah mengikut prosedur tersebut.maaf hanya sekadar hujahan sahaja."
